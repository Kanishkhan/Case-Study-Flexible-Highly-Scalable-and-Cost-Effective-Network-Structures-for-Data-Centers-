Case Study: Flexible and Scalable Network Structures for Data Centers
Overview

Modern data centers must support rapidly increasing workloads from cloud services, big data, and artificial intelligence. Traditional network architectures such as Fat-Tree and Three-Tier provide predictable performance but are costly, power-intensive, and difficult to scale as the data center grows.

This case study examines SDCCP (Scalable Data-Center Network based on Cartesian Product), a modular and cost-efficient topology that enables incremental expansion using commodity switches while maintaining high performance.

Key Concepts

Data Center Networks (DCN) connect large numbers of servers using structured topologies.

Metrics used to evaluate DCNs: scalability, cost per server port, energy consumption, bandwidth, fault tolerance, and average path length.

Traditional DCN architectures: Fat-Tree, Leaf-Spine, BCube, DCell, and flexible reconfigurable models.

Analysis of SDCCP

SDCCP is constructed using the Cartesian product of smaller graph units, resulting in a modular design. This approach:

Reduces deployment and operational cost

Supports step-by-step expansion without network redesign

Maintains short routing paths and high throughput

Lowers power consumption by reducing unnecessary links and switch load
